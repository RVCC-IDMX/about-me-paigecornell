    <h2>The Impact Social Media Has on Youth</h2>
    
    <p class = "dropcap"> S<p>ince the creation of social media, the influence it has had on culture is undeniable. But even more so its effect on the youth who have grown up surrounded by technology, screens and social media. Youth are especially impressionable which makes the amount of social media content they consume potentially all the more dangerous. In this blog post, I will do a deep dive into what experts say are the impacts social media has on youth and teenagers as well as if there are any steps to take to protect them.</p>
    <p>It has been studied and discovered that social media apps are habit-forming for youth. U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has empathized this in a report as recent as 2023. These addictive tendencies of the apps can lead to mental health issues. Dr. Gregory Jantz further backed-up these findings. “It’s toxic for the brain and social development, when the average child, between 8 and 10 years old is spending around 10 hours each day on screens. Jantz explained brains and social skills are developing at this crucial and vulnerable time and as the Surgeon General’s report points out, youth who spend more than three hours per day on social media double the risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes, such as symptoms of depression and anxiety.” (KCAL News Staff, CBS News)</p>
    <p>Cyberbullying has been present in social media since its inception but is even more pronounced in teenagers. Donna Wick, a clinical and developmental psychologist, speaks on this to Child Mind Institute. “Kids text all sorts of things that you would never in a million years contemplate saying to anyone’s face (…) She notes that this seems to be especially true of girls, who typically don’t like to disagree with each other in ‘real life.’” (Rachel Ehmke, Child Mind Institute). These compounded with mental health issues that stem from social media usage can truly inform and shape the vulnerable youth’s mindset as a whole.</p>
    <p>There is also the matter of body image issues that stem from younger people using social media. Teenagers are constantly comparing themselves to what they see on apps such as Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where you are always looking at others in these mediums. Among the problems studied, body image issues seem to be a leading cause when it comes to younger people and social media. </p>
    <p>Ultimately, there are steps that can be taken to help teenagers and the youth of today from experiencing these negative side effects from social media. According to the Surgeon General, there site “calls for engaging in a multifaceted effort to maximize the benefits and reduce the risk of harm posed by social media with actions suggested for groups including: children and adolescents, policymakers, technology companies, researchers and families.” (Author Unknown, the U.S. Surgeon General). It is steps such as setting boundaries with social media, being careful about what you post, and taking measurements to shield yourself and others from cyberbullying. </p>
