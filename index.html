    <h2 class="typed">The History and Practicality of Animated Text</h2>

 
    <p class = "dropcap">A<p>nimated text in website development is an important tool to know as it creates an extra flare for readers who are visiting their page. They may stop and look at a particular section longer, for instance, if they notice animated text rather than still text. It is a topic that others have studied as well, given its enhancement to the website. Animated text, or CSS animation, is the bell and whistle that I chose for my website and you can view it in action by refreshing the page to see the title being typed out. In this blog post, I will be researching the history and practicality of animated text and its overall accessibility in website development.</p>
    <p>The history of animated text goes back to 1899, also known as kinetic typography, where creator Georges Melies implemented the work. Although “Despite being regarded as the father of special effects, much of his work has been lost and there are no examples of his early text animation.” (Author Unknown, “Kinetic Typography and Animation") However, the form of animated text that we know today did not fully emerge until the 1960s. Here, it was often used in movie titles rather than on websites. “This trend was kicked off in 1959 by Saul Bass for the titles of North by Northwest, which saw the animated text “flying” off the screen before fading out into the film itself.” (Author Unknown, “Kinetic Typography and Animation") These two creators put into motion a tool that would be used in a multitude of media formats ever since.</p>
    <p> While I used CSS for this bell and whistle, it should be noted that there are other ways to achieve text animation on a website. For instance, using JavaScript can be another route to take when including text animations, albeit a potentially more advanced method. “Today, motion on the web is achieved by using either CSS Transitions, CSS Keyframes, JavaScript Animations, or a combination of these. So if you see an awesome website, web ad or any other web-based product, chances are you’re looking at an animation created with one of these three technologies.” (Milber Ferreira, “The History of Web Animation”) Animated text is utilized to engage the viewer, and oftentimes viewers do not realize the behind-the-scenes of the feature. Each part of a website, oftentimes, should be viewed as an intentional design. As evidenced in text animation.</p>
    <p>This information brings us to how text animation can be used in future websites and its overall importance for website developers. As mentioned earlier, animated text can cause visitors to linger on your website for a longer period of time, and thus perhaps check out other areas of the site they may not have. There are a number of positive attributes animated text has. For instance, it can “Grab viewers’ attention and keep it. Highlight important information such as a short promo or quote, smoothly transition from one topic to another and increase viewers’ ability to remember the message.” (Author Unknown, “How Text Animation Can Help You Bring Your Business to Life”) Without the work of creators Georges Melies and Saul Bass, website developers would not have had the opportunity to implement this bell and whistle for others to enjoy.</p>
